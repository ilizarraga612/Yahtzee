The objective of Yahtzee is to score the most points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations.
Rolling the Dice:
-Each player takes a turn rolling the five dice.
-Players can roll the dice up to three times per turn to get the highest-scoring combination.
-For the first roll, the player rolls all five dice.
-After the first roll, the player can choose to keep any dice they want and re-roll the rest.
-Players can also choose to stop after the first or second roll if they have a combination they like.
Scoring:
-After rolling, the player chooses a category to score their dice. Each category can only be used once per game.
-Categories are divided into two sections: Upper and Lower Sections.

*Scoring Categories*

-Ones: Sum of all dice showing the number 1.
